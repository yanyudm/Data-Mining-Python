# Data Mining in Python
These learning materials for undergraduate and graduate data mining courses are based on [Dr. Yan Yu](https://www.business.uc.edu/faculty-research/obais/faculty/yan-yu.html)’s class notes. I extend my appreciation to former Ph.D. students from the Lindner College of Business for their contributions, and to [Adriana Gonzalez Sanchez](https://www.business.uc.edu/faculty-research/obais/faculty/students/adriana-gonzalez-sanchez.html) for setting up the initial GitHub page.
